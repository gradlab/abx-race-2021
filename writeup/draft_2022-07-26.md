## Abstract 

## Introduction

Racial/ethnic disparities arise throughout the continuum of care, impacting one's susceptibility to infection<sup>x</sup>, access to care<sup>x</sup>, treatments<sup>x</sup>, and disease outcomes<sup>x</sup>. These disparities are well documented in the context of antibiotic prescribing, where white patients receive substantially more antibiotics than patients of other races/ethnicities<sup>SWO</sup>. Much attention has been placed on managing antibiotic over-consumption, which from the racial/ethnic perspective implies finding ways to counteract the drivers of elevated prescribing to white patients. Still, under-consumption of antibiotics also carries risks, as untreated infections can cause long-term physical harm<sup>x</sup>. It is therefore necessary to find ways to achieve equitable antibiotic prescribing, in which antibiotics are given just as often as they are needed, and also to address upstream inequalities that contribute to inequitable antibiotic consumption.   

It has been unclear to what extent the racial/ethnic disparities in antibiotic prescribing are rooted in epidemiological, patient-related, or provider-related factors. Equity suggests that each racial/ethnic group should have the same (1) probability of aquiring a given infection, (2) access to care (_i.e.,_ the rate and level of care sought for a given illness), and (3) treatment by the care provider (_i.e.,_ the probability of receiving an antibiotic prescription when presenting for a given illness). The observed racial/ethnic disparities in antibiotic prescribing must arise at one or more of these stages of care. To restore equity in prescribing, it is critical to identify where disparities arise within this trajectory of care. For example, if elevated antibiotic consumption in white patients is primarily linked with seeking care for illnesses that do not merit an antibiotic prescription, greater parient and physician outreach ma be warranted. If instead the relatively lower antibiotic consumption in non-white populations is attributable to barriers to care, this suggests more structural interventions are needed to improve access to care for these groups. 

Most fundamentally, it is necessary to estimate the extent to which antibiotic prescribing inequities arise prior to _vs._ from within the provider's office. Some studies<sup>x</sup> indicate that access to care and rates of illness differ between races/ethnicities, implying disparities from outside the provider's office feeding into disparities in prescribing. Other studies <sup>x</sup> indicate that physicians simetimes treat patients of various racial/ethnic backgrounds differently, suggesting an additional potential effect from within the provider's office. Various studies have examined the impact of patient and provider characteristics in determining antibiotic prescribing rates, especially once care has been sought, but we lack a clear understanding of racial/ethnic disparities in pre-visit factors. Improving this understanding would pave the way for more effective and equitable antibiotic stewardship. However, we have lacked data on the patient experience with sufficient demographic information to explicitly link antibiotic prescriptions to their reasons for visits by race and ethnicity. 

Here, we used a nationally representative survey of healthcare visits to assess the relative importance of healthcare utilization and prescribing practice on antibiotic use by race/ethnicity.

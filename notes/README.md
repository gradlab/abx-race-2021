__Introduction__

- Over-consumption of antibiotics is a major challenge given the risk of resistance.
- Under-consumption of antibiotics also poses challenges, as untreated infections can cause long-term physical harm. 
- Antibiotic prescribing rates differ by race/ethnicity (SWO)
- Antibiotic resistance rates also vary by race/ethnicity (DS)
- Equity suggests that each race/ethnicity should have the same (a) probability of infection, (b) access to care (rate of seeing physician given an illness), and (c) treatment by the prescribing physician (odds of receiving a prescription given illness). 
- Inequities in one or more of these areas must be in play; but we don't yet know where. 
- To restore equity in antibiotic prescribing, we first need to understand where inequities arise in the care pathway that leads from illness to antibiotic consumption. 
- Most fundamentally, we need to know the extent to which prescribing inequities arise prior to vs. from within the provider's office. 
- Some studies indicate that access to care and rates of illness differ between races/ethnicities. 
- Other studies indicate that physicians treat patients of different racial/ethnic backgrounds differently. 
- A clearer perspective on the origins of prescribing inequities would pave the way for more effective interventions, whether through preventing disease, improving access to care, or conducting patient or physician outreach. 
- However, we have lacked data on the patient experience with sufficient demographic information to explicitly link antibiotic prescriptions to their reasons for visits by race/ethnicity. 
- Here, we used a nationally representative survey of healthcare visits to assess the relative importance of healthcare utilization and prescribing practice on antibiotic use by race/ethnicity...
